Title: Automation on Drug Interactions Profiling.
 
Problem:
The FDA has a public database, FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), that holds information regarding adverse events to drugs. A common issue in the healthcare system is determining whether a drug is safe or not. Currently a pharmaceutical company needs only prove in human clinical trials that a drug is safe when taken in isolation. However, humans are not basic research subjects and are often taking a number of medications. Therefore, we will be using the FDAâ€™s database to cross-reference cases in which a patient who is taking two drugs has the same adverse event as a patient who is on the same two drugs. In this way we can start to chip away at the issue regarding safety of drug interactions.
 
Data Sources:
The raw data that we will be using will taken from the FAERS Quarterly Data Extract Files which are available online (https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/FPD-QDE-FAERS/FPD-QDE-FAERS.html). The data contains information of the demographics and administrative information, drug information from the case reports, reaction information, patient outcome, and some relation information on the source of the reports. Data provided are available in two formats ASCII and XML. Raw data will be filtered by extracting relevant columns of information relevant to the research methodology. The data are originally extracted from AERS database and disclose to be not cumulative. Hence, there might be overlapped or repeated entries inside database and/or across different files as they are sectioned into different quarters of the year.

Data Cleaning:
For the preliminary examination, the data will be filtered based on the available entries on the data, i.e. assessing missing values in entries and group them based on entries. The main reason is that the program developed will be used in a way that users will be querying information pertaining to the drugs and the program will displayed relevant information regarding to the query. Hence, missing value in entries will hinder the aggregation process; the program may display empty information or there might be complication during retrieval.


Model:
Model proposed for this program will include decision tree, cluster analysis, and/or association analysis. The model will be trained with all currently available data and will also be dynamic in a way that it will adapt with new information fed into the cloud.
Decision tree will assist user to produce output that will predict the likelihood outcome/symptoms a patient might have based on inputs given, i.e. different drugs taken at particular time.
Cluster analysis will be used for specific group of users in medical field, i.e. doctors or scientists, to categorize certain symptoms based on drugs with the hope that they will be able to use information produce to find other replacement drugs that do not give adverse effect to the patient. For initial experimentation, the team will be attempting to cluster information based on symptoms and grouped them based on chemicals component of the drugs. 
Association analysis will also serve the same purpose as clustering analysis, but to the extent of exploring the likelihood of a symptom/outcome by taking chemicals as inputs.
Another data involvement:
Drug ingredients data might be needed to have better understanding on how certain drugs react with each other based on chemical reactions.
